/**
 * The delegated-skin row: a skin whose visual is another plugin's.
 *
 * It renders where the wallpaper controls used to live and where a skin's own
 * card lives now, because it is both: it is a selection (apply it, and it is
 * remembered across a reload) and an install prompt (the plugin that paints it
 * is a separate package). The row is listed whether or not that package is
 * installed, because an installed-and-enabled plugin that the card hid until
 * the user went to the store is a plugin nobody finds.
 *
 * It is a full-width bar ABOVE the skin grid, not a tile among them: it has no
 * preview image (the plugin paints, and this package holds no screenshot of
 * it), so a tile sized for a 16:9 thumbnail would be mostly empty. The bar
 * carries the same head / tagline / actions shape as the custom-theme card
 * below the grid, so the two non-asset looks read as the same kind of row.
 *
 * The body is the LOOK, not the row's state: a short description of what
 * applying it gives you. State belongs to the badge (this row is active) and
 * to the buttons (you can pick it, or you cannot, and here is the button that
 * fixes that). Prose about the row's own state sat where a reader looks for a
 * description of the theme, and said nothing they could not already see.
 *
 * Two states still earn one line each, because in both the row withholds the
 * selection buttons and silence would read as a bug: a plugin that cannot hand
 * the page back yet, and a descriptor the installed package has outgrown.
 *
 * Three states, all read from two sources and never guessed:
 *
 *  - not installed: the one-click install through whichever plugin-management
 *    face the host publishes, or the exact command when it publishes none;
 *  - installed but not live: the plugin is wired into this profile but its
 *    browser half is not on the page, so this row cannot paint yet. The row
 *    says so instead of offering an apply that would deliver nothing;
 *  - live: the plugin paints. Try-on and apply are offered, because from here
 *    the selection is a normal one and every other skin, the stock look and a
 *    running wallpaper all take the page back.
 *
 * A live plugin that does NOT advertise the handoff attribute is a build that
 * cannot stand down. Offering apply on it would let the user select this skin
 * and then pick a real skin over it, which is the broken overlap the whole
 * delegation exists to prevent, so the row says the plugin has to be updated
 * and still lets them look at it.
 *
 * The state that needs care is ABSENT markers while a skin is painted. That is
 * what a working handoff looks like from out here: the plugin is installed,
 * running, and standing down because this card's own skin owns the page. Read
 * as "not running" it both lies and strands the reader — no buttons, no way
 * back — so the row takes {@link DelegatedSkinCardProps.yieldedToSkin} from the
 * card (which knows what is painted), says the plugin yielded, and keeps the
 * try-on / apply buttons: switching back is exactly the action that hands the
 * page over again.
 *
 * Everything the peer publishes is read, never written: the two attributes
 * (see runtime/delegated-theme.ts) and the install call the host itself makes.
 * @module @linxin666/dsh-client-ui-skin-center/DelegatedSkinCard
